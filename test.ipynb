The playbook is intended to \\neducate, inform and constitute a valid reference to how teams in EG should work with respect (but not \\nlimited to) Agile rules and principles in an everyday effort to deliver value. This playbook means to draw \\nboundaries, describing mandatory, unified aspects of EG processes, as well as defining the room for \\nindividual interpretation and freestyle approach (see 2.3 - The common language \\xa0(see page 40)  ). Finally, this \\nplaybook is a mere attempt to define a common, consistent approach to software delivery within EG.\\nWhile the playbook consists of a sufficient amount of information for it to serve its purpose, it will remain a \\nliving document . As the EG organization learns to “play by the rules” of this document, it will continue to be \\nverified and updated, taking into account observations and most valuable feedback. This is a commitment to \\nempirical process control by Inspection & Adaptation . Like in all other areas, which this document \\naddresses, it is crucial to follow the rule of continuous improvement ; there is no exception in regard to the EG \\nAgile Playbook which will grow to be more mature and robust with time.\\n1.2.1 Content of the playbook\\nThe content of the EG Agile Playbook is very diverse and focused on providing the best possible way of \\nexposing clear information and instructions concerning the particular area of the process. This is done by the \\nmeans of:\\nguidelines  - to help understand the step-by-step execution of a part of a process\\nbest practices  - to recommend or indicate the most proven approaches to a particular problem\\nreferences - to support understanding of a particular concept by means of internal/external sources \\nnot directly included in the playbook\\nrules - to explain the mandatory, common parts of the process for everyone\\nexamples - to provide additional materials meant to support execution of the playbook’s rules & \\nguidelines\\nvalues - to educate on the meaning and benefits of the implemented principles & processes of the \\nintroduced commercial and custom frameworks, techniques, as well as methodologies\\n1.2.2 Target recipients of the playbook\\nThe EG Agile Playbook is dedicated to everyone  at EG, who is involved in any way  in the production and \\ndelivery of value, frequently expressed by means of software and associated components.

This approach proves to be very valuable in situations \\nwhere the project and/or team have limitations not allowing full utilization of the Scrum framework.\\nEG Scrum is the leading candidate for the implementation of Small Scale Agile for many reasons including its \\npopularity, developers’ preference, high success rates for Scrum adoption and project deliveries, and strong \\nprinciples and values including focus, courage, openness, commitment, and respect.\\nSmall Scale Scrum can be best described as “a people-first framework defined by and for small teams (a \\nmaximum of three people) and supporting planning, developing, and delivering production-quality software \\nsolutions.” The proposed framework centers around the concept of team members occupying multiple roles \\non any project. Small Scale Scrum is valuable due to its strong support for the small, distributed teams found \\nin organizations all over the world.\\nSmall teams need new ways to meet customers’ continuously growing expectations for rapid delivery and \\nhigh quality, and Small Scale Scrum’s guidelines and principles help address this challenge.\\nSmall Scale Scrum is based on the Scrum framework.

The practices and techniques in scope, aim to \\ntrim and mold the default EG Scrum framework allowing specific contexted teams to make the most out of \\nagile product delivery.\\nConsultancy teams will benefit from an individual alignment during an evaluation process, to determine the \\nbest way of working within the teams.\\nHigh-product-granularity teams  will benefit from common techniques, such as pair-programming, altered \\nbacklog refinement sessions to allow more focus on specialization areas rather than evolvement of the \\nentire team.\\nHigh-product-granularity teams are characterized with a dispersed focus either on multiple areas with high \\nspecialization differentiation within the team, or with working on multiple independent (smaller) products at \\nthe same time. This setup requires the Scrum events or KanBan events to be altered in a way which will drive \\nthe team into a process of reducing the bus factor on the team, while at the same time supporting their \\nexisting product delivery.\\nIn the chapters dedicated to the specific events, you will read about introducing techniques, which are \\ndedicated to teams where their personal competencies need to be acknowledged but also strive to become a \\nwell-functioning unit rather than a group of individuals.\\nBenefits and implications of working with NGA Custom approaches\\ncustom-fit approach → best solution available for the specific team, to raise process utilization and \\nsatissfaction in the teams\\neliminate waste → maximize productivity while accomodating the core of the agile frameworks\\nagile mindset →focus on an agile product delivery process that re-inforces the agile mindset and \\nbuilds on top of it\\xa0\\n1.4.5 DevOps\\nBesides Agile transformation, EG will shift more into DevOps way of \\nworking.

In the end, it is \\nimportant that EG customers are satisfied with the products that are being delivered to them. In order to \\nunderstand and add value to the product, it is defined by a single Jira site, a single Confluence site and of \\ncourse, a single Product Backlog ( more in 5.3 - The Product Backlog \\xa0(see page 160)  ) across the entire EG \\norganization. This is both the starting and finishing point of a journey to build and enhance EG products.\\nThe Product Backlog, defined in Jira is supported by the content in Confluence, including product \\nrequirements and documentation. As a starting point, the teams focus on what is to be delivered, when and \\nwith what value to the product. The finish summarizes if that goal was accomplished and the expected value \\ndelivered, which in turn leads to a decision whether the increment should be launched to production. All this \\nis supported by appropriate artifacts and metrics ( as described in 5 - Managing and using artifacts \\xa0(see page \\n150) ) to enforce Transparency (one  of 3 Scrum pillars ) throughout the processes.\\n2.1.1 Process phases\\nA consistent end-to-end agile software delivery process enables EG to:\\nremain capable of delivering world-class software at a fast pace\\nempower and be empowered while responding to change\\nutilize its full potential and focus on delivering value\\nThe EG processes are built around a portfolio of agile frameworks and methods with Scrum as the default \\nrecommendation. NGA aims to enable complete collaboration of agile teams throughout these processes \\nwhile maintaining compliance with EG governance. Particular roles ( as described in 3 - The team, roles and \\nresponsibilities \\xa0(see page 47)  ) will be responsible for fulfilling their duties in scope of all events, whether we \\ntalk about Scrum sprint cycle, KanBan flow or a dedicated combination of techniques ( as described in  4 - \\nEvents and working together in sprints \\xa0(see page 107)  ).

The Agile Manifest represents values that very well complement all of the frameworks, \\nmethodologies, and other agile techniques in the scope of this playbook, introducing an innovative way of \\nthinking about product development.\\n2.2.1 We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping \\nothers do it.\\nThrough this work we have come to value:\\n2.2.2 Individuals and interactions  over  processes and tools\\nWorking software  over  comprehensive documentation\\nCustomer collaboration  over  contract negotiation\\nResponding to change  over  following a plan\\n2.2.2.1 That is, while there is value in the item on the right, we value the items on the \\nleft more.\\nAgile does not only represent a group of approaches and principles. Agile is a philosophy and it can be a way \\nof life. Agile aims to foster a particular mindset that is so crucial to the successful outcome of any \\nundertaking. The best way to explain that is to elaborate on the 4 fundamental statements:\\n2.2.2.2 Individuals and interactions…\\nFocus on people and the interactions between them first. While tools and processes are useful, very often \\nmaking our everyday work significantly simpler, they can be faulty and misleading in complex projects.

People always come \\nfirst.\\n2.2.2.3 Working software…\\nWhile the need for good documentation should not be underestimated, the measure of success is always the \\nresulting software with its quality and value to the customer first. Creating any kind of documentation should \\nsupport the value of a product that is being built, but its shape nor content can never endanger the delivery or \\nresulting value of that product. With documentation as input, it always needs to be verified that a document \\nis coherent with the product vision and provides added value.\\n2.2.2.4 Customer collaboration…\\nContract negotiations can often lead to situations where the very object around which they are built (the \\nordered Product) is negatively affected through contractual decisions. It is understandable that contracts are \\nneeded to formalize agreements, especially between unfamiliar entities; however, rather putting the focus on \\nbuilding a good relationship with the counterpart and working in an atmosphere full of trust, will impact the \\nnegotiation to be less relevant. This in the end will lead to a more productive collaboration to enrich the \\noutcome value of the product, leaving the contract behind as a simple necessity with basic facts. It’s \\nimpossible to predict everything that may happen within a contract, hence it’s good to remain open to \\nchange instead of spending time on managing such cases.\\n2.2.2.5 Responding to change…\\nThe previous statement was summarized with a mention of openness to change, while this one is about \\nresponding to it. It’s a great habit to plan ahead and most of the products will face the need of having a \\nroadmap or preparing a yearly/quarterly plan. However, in order to comprehend the meaning of this \\nstatement, it’s mandatory to acknowledge the fact that the environment around us changes quickly and \\nfrequently. Thus it is crucial to stay open to new learnings, even if that means changing a part of a feature \\nthat has become obsolete. Much more value will come out of it if the feature is redefined than if it’s delivered \\naccording to the originally intended plan.\\n2.3 2.3 - The common language\\nOne of the main goals of the ongoing transformation is to establish a Common Language, which will define \\nhow we work and deliver software products throughout the entire EG company. A unified, common language \\nwill help to build a coherent understanding and working culture across all Business Units, which will lead to a \\ncloser integration within EG; this will allow delivering better products faster, giving the EG advantage in the \\ncontemporary, dynamically changing market.\\nThe common language is present in the entire EG Agile Playbook, defining the rules, guidelines, and values \\nthat can be distinguished into the mandatory and the freestyle.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",

This constitutes the \\nsole part EG’s identity which must be common for everyone and is defined globally.\\nAs an example, the new Jira issue workflow, as well as Jira Software itself, could be considered as the \\nmandatory part of building EG’s common language. Jira is EG’s official issue management system for agile \\nsoftware development and no other tool should substitute its purpose. Along with Jira, the defined common \\nJira workflow ( as defined in  Jira - issues workflow \\xa0(see page 279)  ) is also a cross-EG official flow for issue \\nmanagement from an idea to a releasable product increment.\\n2.3.2 The Freestyle\\nThe freestyle part of the common language, which also will run its way throughout the playbook, specifies \\nthe areas which are more unrestricted and less specific, allowing a more freestyle interpretation by particular \\nteams or units. It will provide guidelines, ideas, suggestions or a spectrum of options, but will not illustrate an \\nofficial, single way of working in that particular area or topic.\\nAs an example, the Confluence page documents structure is quite flexible to some extent, allowing teams to \\ncustomize the content setup according to their product-based needs. An additional example is selecting the \\nscenarios for running a Sprint Retrospective ( see 4.6 - The Sprint Retrospective \\xa0(see page 126)  & 6.3 - \\nExamples \\xa0(see page 427)  ). The fact of a necessity to run a retrospective would fall under the category of the \\nmandatory part of the common language in case of teams working with the pure EG Scrum approach, \\nhowever, choosing a scenario template or working out a custom one is freedom given by the common \\nlanguage’s freestyle.\\n2.3.3 CTO Common Language definition\\nWhile attempting to define a more tangible representation of the EG Common Language, the following listing \\nwas built, to help visualize its most relevant elements:\\n2.3.3.1 Mandatory elements of the EG Common Language\\nbacklog management tool: Jira with default EG configuration\\ncontent mgmt./release notes tool: Confluence with default EG configuration\\nsource code management tool: GitHub\\nbuild automation tools: GitHub Actions (preferred.

It’s not always possible to expect such a scenario, but being together in a team \\nrequires team members to be respectful and open to each other.\\nAre the team members fully co-located or fully distributed?\\nTeams work best when sitting next to each other - that is the most efficient way to communicate. \\nWhile that is not always possible in a contemporary enterprise model, one should seek to construct a \\nfully distributed team setup.

As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, those that practice the \\nmethodology use different sets of tools - referred to as toolchains, rather than a single one. These toolchains \\nare expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development \\nand delivery process:\\nCoding – code development and review,\\xa0source code management tools, code merging\\nBuilding –\\xa0continuous integration.

What is relevant is \\nthat any cadence should be consistent and stable for the entire team. Below you will find a further overview \\nof the cadence concept in EG.\\n4.1.1 Synchronized cadence in EG\\nThe default cadence in EG is 2 weeks  long and is synchronized to foster awareness throughout the EG \\ncommunity, as well as simplify organization and eliminate mutual communication issues during Scrum \\nevents. All EG Sprints should start and be completed on Tuesdays or Wednesdays (of the same week across \\nteams). In the case of KanBan service-oriented events, the cadence could be 1 week long as well if the \\nfeedback loop requires it; nevertheless, the timing of the cadence changed should be aligned analogically \\nwithin the organizational unit.\\nThe journey to a synchronized sprint cadence across EG is one passing through 3 levels of the organization \\nstructure and should be considered a learning path to reaching such a demanding yet beneficial setup.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 106}),\n",

Rather than questioning and expecting something to be ensured \\nor delivered by either role, provide a helping hand, ask how to support in meeting a specific \\nrequirement; collaborate and communicate.\\n4.2.5 Small Scale Scrum\\xa0\\nSmall Scale Scrum is a framework that emphasizes communication between team members.

Try to avoid closure in domain \\nsilos. Share your knowledge and be open to new learnings.\\xa0\\nFor teams with domain/functionality silos highly present, a refinement session might be challenging at the \\nbeginning. \\xa0Becoming a cross-functional team with a common goal(s) is a process. In those cases, it's \\nreasonable to consider splitting the refinement session into two parts:\\nThe common session, for all scrum team members, with a high-level perspective of functionalities \\nand priorities\\nSubgroup session(s), for developers interested in specific domain issues. Detailed level perspective, \\nincluding working out the best method of implementation and estimation of complexity. Product \\nOwner is not required here but he could be engaged if such a need arises (i.e. need for the \\nclarification of acceptance criteria). It is recommended that the subgroup sessions are not limited \\nonly to one developer, because in such a situation we miss the knowledge share on a detailed level. It \\nis good to align the subgroup session(s) with PO and between each other so the PO becomes \\navailable to the team for required alignment.\\nThat approach is a good starting point and as the maturity of the team increases with experience and \\nknowledge sharing thrive, the relation of common sessions to domain sessions should also grow \\naccordingly. The team should strive to achieve the level of cross-functionality that enabling a swarming \\neffect.\\n4.2.7 Consultancy teams\\nIn the consultancy teams, we can distinguish two types of issues that are subject to the refinement process:\\ncustomer-funded development which previously was the subject of review and estimation;\\nother issues that are being refined in an ordinary way, which were not subject to the previous review \\nby developers.\\nThe refinement process to the first group of the issues should focus  on discussing and agreeing on the \\nareas that were not yet covered in the already specified requirements. It is due to make clear of what is \\nexpected to be delivered. On the other hand, we should discuss the way that the scope of the work will be \\ndelivered.  We should as well dedicate some effort to the work breakdown so it is possible to deliver the \\nimportant issues (customer-funded development) in the most efficient way. The second group of \\nrequirements should be refined in a standard way, as described above in the chapter.\\nIn the consultancy teams, the Consultants are the persons who are closely working with the customers and \\nwho are highly aware of the customer's requirements and expectations. Due to this reason, it is \\nrecommended to invite the selected consultants to the dedicated parts of the Refinement meeting so they \\ncan act as domain experts and can provide the needed or required input. On the other hand, if some input or \\nclarification is still missing, the required content can be gathered faster if Consultants are aware of that and \\nengaged in the process itself.\\nIf there are many issues that consultants should participate in during the Refinement meeting, it is worth \\nreflecting to divide the Refinement meeting into two separate parts, as described in the high granularity \\nteams above. This can improve the efficiency of the Refinement process and reduce the Consultant's \\nengagement.\", metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 115}),\n",

Each particular stage \\nrepresents a stage in the team’s progress towards reaching an optimal performance level and each stage \\ncharacterizes with specific observed team behavior:\\nForming - this is the initial stage, usually the beginning period of a new team, where everyone is \\nanticipating to get to know each other and the tasks they will be conducting as a team. The members \\nare not yet acting as a team, but rather a group of individuals. It may take some time for them to work \\ntogether before moving to the next stage.\\nStorming  - this is the stage, at which the boundaries are being tested and team member’s individual \\nhabits clash against each other, often leading to conflicts and frustration. During this stage, \\nrelationships and distinct roles clarify within the team, as well as is the goal of the team, which may \\nbe challenged and questioned. Many teams do not last through this stage and dissolve.\\nNorming  - once past the Storming stage, the team begins to stabilize. The rules and boundaries have \\nbecome set, relationships have been established, the team begins to identify each other’s strengths \\nand weaknesses. Members of the team associate themselves with the team identity and commit to \\nthe goal. This stage may overlap in cycles with Storming, if significant changes to the team are \\nintroduced, in order to adapt to them.\\nPerforming  - this is the most anticipated stage of the team’s development, since at this point their \\nefficiency has reached the optimal level. The team is no longer focused on establishing its rules, \\nprocesses and relations, hence strives to reach its goal and purpose with highest performance.

It represents the moment when the team dissolves, either due to \\ncompletion of its purpose and goal, or resulting from external factors, such as intentional \\nrestructuring. Some teams do not reach this stage for many years, if their intent is to be formed as \\nlong-living teams dedicated to sustainable products.\\n4.8.2 Team election\\nScrum teams can come to be in various organizational circumstances: quite frequently the set of team \\nmembers is pre-defined or is formed from a pre-existing group previously conducting other tasks. In other \\ncases, teams are formed as a result of restructuring or taken as subsets of a larger group. In the later, it is a \\ngood and beneficial practice to conduct team self-election workshops.\\nSome of the benefits include:\\nhigher team morale\\nsense of responsibility and accountability for the constructed team\\nshorter Storming stage, due to potential existing relationships between team members\\nteam self-management\\xa0introduced at the very beginning stage\\nIn order to conduct the election workshops:\\nthe affected group should be gathered together\\nthe goal / purpose of the future team(s) should be presented (usually representing a product or parts \\nof the product that need work)\\nthe restrictions or requirements should be addressed, which need to be considered by the \\nparticipants during team election, such as:\\nteam seniority balance\\nmandatory team competences\\nother factors as seen needed for the goal and purpose of the new team(s)\\nusing a whiteboard or flip chart, empty sections for team(s) should be created\\nusing a timebox (depending on the number of participants), the participants should discuss and self-\\nassign themselves to the team(s)\\nafter all participants completed the task, team roosters may be read out and confirmed (checking if \\nall of the restrictions have been met)\\n4.8.3 Team identity\\nWith both newly formed teams and with existing, but dysfunctional teams it’s extremely helpful to attempt to \\nestablish a team identity which will help to bring the team together to focus on a common goal. There are 3 \\nbasic elements, which can contribute to establishing a better team identity:\\nTeam name  - every team should have a name. The name should be chosen by the team itself, by \\nmeans of a vote or any other technique if there are multiple propositions made within the team. The \\nteam name cannot be imposed by anyone external to the team, such as a manager, however there \\ncan be guidelines to the name in order to reach a convention across the organization. This guideline ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 137}),\n",

It may have similar guidelines to the \\nteam name and perhaps additionally a unified visual requirement across the organization, to \\nstrengthen the organizational identity in addition to that of the team.\\nTeam slogan - a team slogan supports the team identity verbally. It should be simple, catchy, most \\nlikely a single simple sentence. The team slogan should relate strongly to the vision of the team, thus \\nadding another level of building the commitment of the team towards its goal and purpose. The \\nslogan should not be offensive or disturbing in any way and it should adhere to the organizational \\nvalues.\\nThese three elements may be established by newly formed teams also as an additional part to the team \\nelection workshops. For existing teams, they may occur at a desired moment in time - but the sooner the \\nbetter.\\n4.8.4 Team personal maps\\nA good way to get a team started (or restarted for that matter) is building personal maps together as an \\nintegration activity. The exercise is best conducted as a short workshop with the team - it may as well be a \\npart of one retrospective. Personal maps are a concept from Management 3.0 and prove to be very effective \\nin improving team collaboration.\\n4.8.4.1 Create your own\\nGather the team for everyone to create the personal maps on their own and finally share with the rest of the \\nteam one by one. Of course set a pre-defined timebox for the exercise. To create the personal maps:\\nWrite your name in the middle\\nNote down max. 10 main topics around your person - it’s good to make them common across the \\nteam\\nNote details with respect to your person regarding the main topics (sub-topics can be introduce to \\nintroduce a better, more detailed structure)', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 138}),\n",

Instead of building \\na personal map of yourself as an introduction, create one for a one of your teammates (sitting at a table, \\nchoose the person to your right, and so on for the rest of the team). Build his/her personal map, present and \\ndiscuss how well you were able to identify your colleague.\\n4.8.5 Team working agreement\\nAnother fundamental tool to use, whether it’s a new team or an existing one, trying to become a bit more self-\\nmanaged, is a team working agreement. A team working agreement is a set of rules created and agreed by \\nthe entire team. This document should be enforced and followed strictly by all the members of the team who \\nparticipated in its creation; occasionally the TWA may be updated (every quarter or half of a year) to improve \\nit or if there have been significant changes to the team structure. It’s a good practice to hang the TWA in a \\nvisible place near the team’s location or in a virtual space, such as the Confluence team page ( 5.8 - Team \\npage \\xa0(see page 211) ).\\nThe rules mentioned in the team working agreement should focus on the following categories:\\n', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 139}),\n",

Similarly, when in need of verifying and updating the TWA. The workshop can be conducted \\nin many simple forms; for instance:\\ngathering input from all team members, on rule and agreement propositions in any of the mentioned \\ncategories\\ndot-voting on the top most 10-15 propositions overall across all categories and using them as the \\ninitial set composing the team working agreement\\nAs the team works with respect to their TWA, they will inspect it and adapt it if needed periodically.\\n4.8.6 Team expansion & modification\\nDespite high focus on stable, long-living teams, the occasional need for changes within Scrum Teams is \\ninevitable. Whether the cause is staff rotation or expanding the team size (more resources may be needed \\nwithin the size limits of a Scrum Team) there should be an organized way to introduce the changes with \\nminimized impact on the team performance and morale. This section focuses in general on high capacity \\nchanges, concerning multiple team members, where the need to form additional teams arises. Single-\\nmember modification should be manageable within the team itself, as long as the principles of Scrum are \\nrespected.\\nThere are 2 main approaches to introducing team changes:\\n“divide & conquer” or mixing\\nshadowing\\n4.8.6.1 Divide & conquer\\nThe “divide & conquer” strategy is based on taking an existing, experienced team and splitting it up into 2 \\nnew teams while adding “new members” to both of the newly formed teams. This is a more revolutionary \\napproach, since it introduces the most changes to the current, functioning team setup. However, it will result \\nin faster team ramp up, due to the close collaboration of mixed experienced and new team members. The \\ndrawback is initial drop in team velocity and stability, which the new teams will need to rebuild in their new \\nform.\\n4.8.6.2 Shadowing\\nThe shadowing strategy is based on creating 1 new team composed of the “new members”. During the ramp \\nup phase, the team will closely shadow  or follow an existing, experienced team in its duties in order to learn \\nthe product, the code, the rules, etc. The benefit of using this approach is the lack of need to break up, what \\ncould be a well performing, stable team. Naturally, the ramp up time will be much longer for the new team, ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 140}),\n",

An Agile Coach should be consulted should such need arise to evaluate the \\nneed for either one.\\n4.8.7 Team relative estimation synchronization\\nFor those teams estimating their Product Backlog in story points, or another method of abstract, relative \\nestimation, the most difficult part is getting a common understanding of what the given values represent \\nacross the team. Usually the team’s perception of a common language of “story points” develops as the \\nteam continues to work forward, however it is quite helpful to conduct a synchronization session after the \\nfirst several sprints, in order to speed up the alignment.\\nThe input to the session is a set of user stories, which were estimated and completed by the Scrum\\xa0Team in \\nthe last 6 sprints. Having done the user stories, the team is aware of the actual complexity, time and \\nmaterialized risk that came with their delivery, hence has an experience-based reference in regard to their \\neffort.\\nIt’s best to prepare for the exercise with print-outs of the user stories. Make sure to cover/hide the initial \\nestimation that was done during planning (it can be revealed after the session to compare it with the post-\\nsession results). The synchronization session consists of 4 parts:\\nTaking the user stories and arranging them on a table or on the ground with respect to the time  factor \\n- depending on how time-consuming the user story was, from the left (least consuming) to the right \\n(most consuming). After the stories were ordered mark each one with a number, starting from 1 (on \\nthe left), incrementing the value by 1 for each consecutive item to the right of the previous one. The \\nlabel next to this number with “T” or “time” to identify the value with the variable.\\n', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 141}),\n",

After ordering the items, create story point \\nbuckets with the following values: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21+. Assign the left most item to the (1) bucket and the \\nrightmost item to the (21+) bucket. For the remaining items go one by one and discuss them together \\nwhile attempting to continue the assignment of the remaining items in between the created buckets. \\nThe discussion here is crucial since it drives the main goal of the session, which is getting a common \\nunderstanding of the reason behind the estimations by all team members.\\nIn the end, uncover the initial estimates of the user stories and compare how you did as a team - just \\nfor reference, comparing the “before” and “after”.\\nThe user stories in the buckets (at most 3 from each bucket - if there are more, select the most \\nrepresentative ones) now constitute a set of reference user stories for the team! They may be used in the \\nfuture by the team, during Backlog Refinement sessions and Sprint Planning to help gain a common \\nestimation if it becomes a challenge for the team. The reference estimation set should be stored in a team \\nspace in Confluence and it is also good practice to have some print outs available for the team during the \\nestimation sessions for support if necessary. As the team matures, the use of these reference user stories \\nbecomes less frequent or even unnecessary.\\n4.9 4.9 - Events for Kanban teams\\n4.9.1 Events in Kanban\\nAll Events/ Meetings in Kanban are optional \\xa0and should be decided by the team which should be used. \\nHowever, they might be valuable from the \"Implementing Feedback loops\" perspective. Kanban defines \\nseven specific feedback opportunities or cadences. Cadences are the cyclical meetings and reviews that \\ndrive evolutionary change and effective service delivery. “Cadence” may also refer to the time period between \\nreviews—one workday or one month, for example: Choosing the right cadence is context-dependent and it is \\ncrucial to good outcomes. Too-frequent reviews may compel changing things before seeing the effect of \\nprevious changes, but if they are not frequent enough, poor performance may persist longer than necessary.\\nA scheme of seven cadences, depicted below, shows suggested frequencies for the reviews in a typical \\nenterprise or multiple service context', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 142}),\n",

While for a long time the allocation of resources, budgeting and process management was \\nmaintained in project scope, an essential change came with the popularization of Scrum, KanBan and other \\nAgile frameworks, promoting the product- and service-valued mindset.\\nThe definition of Scrum states:\\nScrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively \\nand creatively delivering products of the highest possible value .\\nIt is quite clear, that Scrum, including Small Scale Scrum places the product, as well as the value delivered \\nwith it, in the middle of all its rules and principles. Hence the teams and processes being built in EG Scrum \\nare also having a product-centric approach and reasoning. Nevertheless, it is not that product is replacing the \\nproject, but rather the product becomes the first chair, while projects become natural entities to support their \\ndelivery with maximal value.\\nAccording to the KanBan University:\\n... delays introduce risk to your ability to provide predictable and reliable products and services .

Conducting triage, refinement and \\nestimation of the Product Backlog can be a bit specific in 2 different situations:\\nProduct ramp-up  - when a product is being started, there is a need to build an initial Product Backlog, triage, \\nrefine and estimate it, for Agile Teams to be able to start their work. It is sufficient to have only a part of the \\nProduct Backlog ready for the teams to start, but it is also valuable to have an overview of the complete, \\ndefined work to be known at the time being. Triage, refinement and estimation of an initial backlog are \\nusually more high-level and not so detailed, due to the fact that the scope of the items, which need to be \\ntackled is huge. It is impossible to accurately prepare the whole Product Backlog for the next iteration. That \\nis why this stage should give everyone an overview and an introduction to what’s to come.\\nOngoing product development  - during the normal operating mode, when Scrum Teams are working to \\ndeliver a potentially releasable product increment each Sprint or during upcoming delivery preparation by \\nKanBan teams, the context of triage, refinement and estimation is a bit different. Firstly, the focus is usually \\nmostly on the next upcoming Sprint or interation (to have a list of items, which meet the Definition of Ready \\n5.5 - The Definition of Ready \\xa0(see page 176)  ). Secondly, the focus is on the next 1-2 Sprints or iterations after \\nthe next one, keeping in mind that some items need more time to be prepared than others ( 4.2 - The Backlog \\nRefinement \\xa0(see page 113)  ). While refinement of the Product Backlog can occur on a regular basis, either by \\nthe Product Owner him/her self (to the extent possible) and/or by the Developers, the estimation can only be \\ndone by the Developers without external interference. As compared to the product ramp-up phase, both \\nrefinement and estimation of the Product Backlog at this stage are much more detail-oriented, as the scope \\nin question is also much smaller.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 151}),\n",

KanBan's backlog is a bit more \\ndynamic since the service-oriented nature of the KanBan method makes it less realistic to have a complete, \\ndefined scope of work to be known at any given time. Nevertheless, all known work to be done by a KanBan \\nteam, and each and every new learning that needs to land on the KanBan board, becomes a part of the living \\nbacklog artifact for a KanBan team.\\nThe moment when the Product Backlog becomes a bit more complex is in the case of High-Granularity-\\nTeams, which work on delivering multiple products at the same time. Working on multiple smaller products \\nis always a possibility for a single Scrum or KanBan team who can use their competencies to address the \\nresolution of more than one complex problem. That being the case, in addition to refinement and estimation \\nfor a single product as mentioned in this chapter, the team(s) need to tackle the challenge of prioritizing \\nmultiple Product Backlogs to end up with a single ordered list for the team to work on. This is something that \\nshould involve the PM (preferably one) or PMs of the mentioned products to help identify the expected order \\nin agreement with the forecasted roadmaps of the products.\\n5.2.2 Initial Product Backlog preparation\\nThe journey to the first Product Backlog starts with the definition of the product to be built. Once the idea \\nexists, there are multiple techniques for going from Product Vision to Product Backlog items (i.e. Vision-Box, \\nmore in 8.3 - Examples \\xa0(see page 427) ). The fun starts with an initial Product Backlog that has been defined; at \\nthis point, the questions that come to mind include:\\nis this technically feasible to be done at all?\\nhow much of it can be done in time X? how much more in time X+Y?\\nwhat dependencies exist regarding the scope?\\nwhat competences are needed and in how many teams?\\nIn order to address most of these questions, it’s a good idea to organize a full-day event, dedicated to triage/\\nrefinement/estimation of the initial Product Backlog items.

The Minimum Viable Product \\ndefines the scope of the Product Backlog which \\nis mandatory  for that Product to launch to \\nproduction. The MVP is the smallest, most \\nfundamental version of the Product, which has \\nbusiness value and can be made available to the \\ncustomer. The MVP should be agreed with the \\nAgile Team(s) starting work on the product, to \\ngive the Product Owner an assumption that this \\nscope of work can be done in the defined time \\nperiod with high probability.

But how to get the prioritization \\nright? One of the methods to support backlog prioritization is called by the acronym MoSCoW .\\nItems in the Product Backlog should be evaluated with respect to 4 categories of the MoSCoW technique, to \\nestablish their relative priority:\\nMust have  - defines an item, which is vital for the end solution (MVP) and must be completed in order for the \\nend solution to be releasable and usable. This applies to all items, which i.e. are:\\ncore features of the product\\nlegal requirements\\nsecurity & safety requirements\\nShould have  - defines an item, which has a high priority for the end solution and should be completed if \\npossible (if time and resources allow). This applies to all items, which i.e. are:\\nhigh value features of the product\\nperformance requirements\\nefficiency and productivity related requirements (i.e. removing workarounds)\\nCould have  - defines an item, which is considered to be valuable for the end solution, but is not necessary. \\nSuch as:\\ndesirable, “nice to have” features of the product\\nfancy, visual, UX requirements\\n', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

KanBan is all about \\nthroughput, managing the flow and while the aspect of delivering a product or service with a focus on quality \\nis still on the agenda, there is no specifically defined target. One of the main differences between Scrum and \\nKanBan, is the lack of sprint goals which drive the focus for an upcoming iteration in the KanBan method. \\nThat means while there can still be multiple benefits in using MVP in KanBan delivery, it may vary depending \\non the type of work that is actually being done. Maintenance teams for example may not be able to define a \\nvalid MVP for their product at all, since their focus is on the delivery of service and support, rather than \\nproduct increments.\\nIt is always important to identify what do we want to accomplish with a defined MVP and the approximate \\ntime frame we hope to deliver it in, to see if this is a realistic approach for our team and product.\\n5.2.5 Estimating\\nA fundamental part of working with the Product Backlog involves some kind of evaluation of the effort of \\nthose items which need to be done. Estimations are used because it is difficult to define the exact metric \\n(time, cost) for doing something when planning ahead. The closer to doing something, the better the \\nestimates and they become even more accurate with every step during their implementation; empirically we \\nfind out what in facts is needed to complete the item, which was forecasted before.\\nEstimation consists of 3 factors that conclude to the overall EFFORT:\\nTime - how time-consuming the task is\\nComplexity - how complicated the task is\\nRisk - what can go wrong, the uncertainty, the dependencies\\nA common way to express effort estimation in Scrum or other Agile frameworks is relative estimation.\\n5.2.5.1 Relative estimation\\nRelative effort estimation signifies forecasting the amount of work that needs to be done for an item to be \\ncomplete, as compared to other items that potentially have been already completed (less than item X, more \\nthan item Y). During the estimation, we take the 3 factors into account: time to do it, the complexity of doing \\nit, and the risk that comes with doing it.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",

The responsibility for creating sub-tasks falls \\nonto the Developers, which should identify all known tasks that exist at the time. While the team should aim \\nto identify most of the work up-front, it is not possible to foresee everything. If additional pieces of work are \\ndiscovered during the sprint, sub-tasks may be created and added to the backlog item, however, it should be \\nverified prior if it does not affect the overall Sprint scope and Sprint Goal. An indication of a good break-down \\nand earlier Backlog refinement sessions is a resulting item decomposition that results in 80-90% of sub-\\ntasks being identified during Sprint Planning.\\n5.3.3.6 Task\\nA Task represents a set of engineering, investigation, proof of concept or technical debt work that is not \\ndirectly related to a user story and is not visible as a product increment to an end-user. They should be \\ntreated as a separate item because they consume time and need to be planned, refined, estimated and \\ntracked. Below you will find a specific sort of work, which can be addressed in the Tasks:\\nTraining  - if the particular team members need to share the knowledge and they are positive that it will take a \\nsubstantial part of the Sprint time, a slot for this time allocation can be created under the Task. This can \\nprovide the visibility of such activities and time estimated to achieve it. Each such task should have a \\ndescription of what knowledge will be shared and the desired output of the education process.\\nRetrospective improvements  - Tasks are also being used for assigning and tracking the progress of the \\nselected improvements, which are the outcome of the previous Sprint Retrospective meeting. This can \\nprovide the visibility and certainty that the improvement process towards Scrum perfection is addressed for \\nthe Team. A good practice is to assign the particular Team member to the Task so we have an advocate of \\nthe change, who will take care of the selected improvements.\\nThe distinction between tasks and sub-tasks is that sub-tasks are decomposed pieces of work for particular \\nbacklog items and can’t be independent items. On the contrary Tasks are independent items and pieces of \\nwork to be done. For better planning and execution during Sprint, Tasks can be split into Sub-tasks.\\n5.3.3.7 Bugs\\nBugs or defects are items that represent an improper functioning, malfunctioning or lack of functioning of a \\nfeature expressed within a previously implemented backlog item. Handling bugs is a part of software \\ndelivery. We can distinguish several types of bugs that determine how we handle them in Scrum.\\nThe first layer is to determine where the bugs were found:\\nthey were found “during the current Sprint” delivery and they are  related to  the items assigned to the \\ncurrent Sprint ? or\\nthey are not related to the current sprint delivery .\\nThe second layer of bug classification is answering the question of affecting the Product functionality:\\nis the particular piece of Product not working as designed ? or\\nis it not designed as it should work ?\\nMinding the above we can classify four types of bugs:', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 167}),\n",

In such situations when \\na defect of this nature has been noticed, we should communicate the observation as soon as possible to the \\nProduct Owner and the team.

In Scrum, the Developers are responsible for the creation of working, potentially \\nshippable product increment. But when handling bugs the rule is that if possible they should come to the \\ncreator of the faulty code if possible to be tracked. Such an approach supports taking responsibility for your \\nown work and efficiency because creators are familiar with their own code and can fix bugs fast.\\nServiceNow incoming Jira issues\\nA part of the Product Backlog can be build up by issues originating from 3rd party customer support \\nsystems, such as ServiceNow. In the end, such issues, whether classified as bugs, tasks or user stories \\nbecome an integral part of the Product Backlog with ServiceNow being only the source system of the new \\nbug or new feature. What characterizes such issues is usually an increased need for their refinement prior to \\nconsidering them part of the main Product Backlog. These issues do not originate directly from the Product \\nOwner or Scrum team, hence they may require additional assessment and communication with the support \\nconsultants to clarify their description or justification. All of the preparatory work done by the Developers on \\nissues coming from external support systems should be included as part of the backlog refinement capacity \\nthat the team dedicates to preparation of the Product Backlog for the next Sprint Planning events.\\n5.3.4 Managing Product Backlog - tips for Product Owner\\nWork with Product Backlog on a daily basis – make it a habit. Product Backlog should be a living \\norganism. This means that it should reflect the current state of the product requirements. Don\\'t \\npostpone the Product Backlog management activities so they cumulate and create a snowball. It will \\ncost you a lot of energy to bring it back to life and you can always forget about something important. \\nThe Product Backlog is a transparent artifact and no one wants to review outdated information. It is \\nhard to discuss the things that should be done when you cannot find them in the Backlog or the input \\nis not relevant. Keep the backlog up to date so you are ready for discussion anytime.\\nLet the others do Backlog management activities - Since you are accountable you are also allowed to \\nlet the Developers\\xa0do some of the activities i.e.: clarifications, updates, dependency identification, \\ncomments. This may prevent you to be a burden in backlog work engagement and will help the team-\\nbuilding process. You must also remember not to give anybody outside the Scrum Team credentials \\nto manage the backlog. You can agree on the changes, but it is your final decision and job to update \\nthe Backlog.\\nFocus on \"what\" and \"why\". Leave the \"how\" to the Developers \\xa0- You should be clear about what you \\nwant to be changed in the Product. Remember about the MVP concept 5.2 - Grooming and estimating \\nan initial Product Backlog18 and the reason standing behind that. Don\\'t forget to be specific about \\nacceptance criteria, be aware of corner cases or alternative flows, express exclusions to be clear \\nabout the Jira item scope. On the other hand, try to avoid any suggestions on how you would like to \\nhave the change to be done. Leave it to the Developers\\xa0– they know best how to do it in the most \\nefficient way.\\nDon\\'t forget to delete obsolete items  - Many Product Owners remember about adding new features \\nand Product changes but they tend to forget about deleting the items that became redundant. Don\\'t \\nkeep the items that you know will never be done. Just get rid of it and keep your backlog clear and \\nmore manageable.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 169}),\n",

This refers at least to clear Product Backlog Items description, up to date \\nbacklog order and content as well as clear priorities. This will gravely improve stakeholders and \\nparticular expectations management by having the whole picture in one place.\\nDon\\'t try to complete the product backlog scope  - The Product Backlog scope is never-ending activity \\nlasting as long as the Product itself lasts. You should treat Product Backlog management as a \\nconstant activity instead of making it done approach. This can lead you to frustration and anger \\nbecause the backlog will extend and keep changing all the time. Instead of a holistic approach, try to \\nfocus on close future activities and top backlog items, keeping in mind whole product vision.\\nRemember it is all about maximizing the value  - The Product Owner is the value catalyst. He is \\nspeeding the value delivery reaction by ordering the backlog well. When doing such activities please \\nremember not only about the revenue side. You must keep in mind also a cost side (this may come \\nfrom the Developers\\xa0feedback) and value the whole balance.\\nFocus on collaboration  - The Product Owner is a person who is in the centre of all activities \\naccumulating all the discussion with stakeholders and with the Team. Collaboration is a key factor \\nfor you to be successful. Discuss, collaborate, negotiate and learn to say \"no\" or \"yes, but not now\".

During item decomposition, the Developers\\xa0can dig in deeper \\ninto the details to have a better understanding of the work that needs to be done.\\nwhat items or activities should be done first to execute the Sprint in the most efficient manner  - \\nsometimes it is better to deliver the Sprint Backlog in a particular order. For example, solving the Bug \\naddressed within the Sprint can determine the faster delivery or different solution of another User \\nStory or a Bug.

Some of the \"customer-funded development\" functionalities that we \\ndevelop might be tested on the customer side (it depends on the agreement). If this is the case there might \\nbe some challenges regarding issues completion within the sprint (which we should aim for). It happens in \\nsituations where the customer\\'s validation can\\'t be completed by the Sprint ends.\\nThe general rule here is that we should do as much as possible, to collaborate with customers in such a way, \\nthat all the job end-2-end is being done within the sprint. If this for justified reasons can\\'t be achieved - there \\nare two practices that can be applied:\\nTreat it as \"done\" -\\xa0 In this approach, you are considering the issue \"Done\" as soon as all on our side is \\ndone and the issue is handled over for validation to the customer. Since this is the end of the \\ndevelopment process on our side and we did the basic validation on our side, we can interpret that in \\nour context this is the end of the process and the issue can be moved to \"Done\" status in Jira. This \\nmeans as well that if any bugs are being raised by the customer after validation, will be created in Jira \\nas independent issues linked to the main issue already moved to \"Done\".\\nPut it to a side -\\xa0 If for any reason we don\\'t want to apply the above rule in our context, there is an \\nalternative that you can introduce. In the situation that we want to keep the issue open till the \\nmoment when it is considered done after the customer\\'s validation, we can remain the issue open by \\nthe end of the Sprint. As soon as Sprint is closed the issues are being moved to the backlog or \\ndedicated slot (sprint slot, i.e. \"awaiting customer\\'s validation\"), waiting for customer\\'s feedback. \\nThere are not being taken into the upcoming sprint, but the team is leaving some capacity free in the \\nupcoming Sprint to have the possibility to add issues into the sprint if needed. As soon as the \\ncustomer\\'s validation results arrive and there is some work to be done, the team is taking the issue \\ninto the sprint and work under it for successful completion. This approach can be considered as a \\n\"Backlog management\" activity that is being done by the Product Owner. This approach will reduce \\nthe negative impact of moving the \"unfinished\" issues from Sprint to Sprint and give you more \\nprecision in crafting the future Sprint\\'s scope.\\nThe above-mentioned solutions do not fulfill the whole spectrum of possibilities. If there is an alternative that \\ncan be successfully applied in your context - please consult it with a dedicated NGA Agile Coach and agree \\non the final shape to be implemented.\\n5.4.8 High Product Granularity teams\\nAll above is applicable for the high Product Granularity teams however there are some areas that need to be \\nemphasized:\\nsince in this category, we are having a high specialization level and not all the team members will be \\nable to deliver the issues, we have to dedicate some extra energy to creating the plan for Sprint scope \\ndelivery.\\xa0This means that we should take all the Sprint scope under consideration validating if we \\ndon\\'t have any bottlenecks or big gaps between the team members handling the work between each \\nother;\\nwhen crafting the Sprint scope we should more closely look at the personal workload perspective to \\nmake sure that the scope is possible to be delivered;\\neach Sprint is an opportunity to reduce the BUS factor, so to move forward we should do as much as \\npossible towards knowledge share ( i.e. by pair-programming);\\nit is good to craft the sprint goal first and then build the scope around it.

The purpose of team metrics isn’t accountability, status management \\nnor input for status reports. The purpose is to help the team plan better, to identify and address their weak \\npoints, to self-inspect and adapt. Naturally, information coming out of team metrics is a valuable source of \\ninformation on:\\nhow the team is developing as a group?\\nis the team on a good way to reaching stability?\\nis the team’s productivity growing or decreasing?\\nwhat impact did any changes or external factors have on the team performance?\\nBased on that information, an Agile Coach or the team’s manager can make decisions to support the team \\nand help in reaching their goals, if they are facing unresolvable impediments.\\nRemembering the Agile Manifesto:\\n“…individuals and interactions over  processes and tools…“\\nit is crucial to treat team metrics accordingly - as a means to help teams develop and improve, rather than \\nmonitor them and hold them accountable for the results.\\n5.7.1 Velocity\\nVelocity  is most likely the single most relevant metric for a Scrum Team to use.

To be specific, a Scrum Team can focus on 2 types of velocity (4 in total taking \\ninto account the Capacity aspect - please see next part “Capacity”):\\nSprint Velocity  - is an instantaneous value resulting from the number of Story Points, which were \\nburned down  (or completed) in the last sprint.\\nAverage Velocity  - is an average out of a series of consecutive Sprints of the Scrum Team, usually \\nlimited to 6-12 last Sprints. The average velocity, as compared to Sprint Velocity, does not show the \\nchange of value from Sprint to Sprint, but rather a trend in which the Scrum Team is heading.\\nBoth of the values provide some information on the team’s wellbeing, however the average velocity informs \\nus whether the team is stable or not - and that is a piece of key information. Average velocity is prone to \\nminor deviations in the sprint to sprint velocities, so unnecessary panic is avoided once a “bad sprint” occurs \\nonce in a while. The average velocity also informs us whether any changes that occurred in or around the \\nteam, had a positive or negative impact on their performance.\\nIn addition to being a sort of a health monitor for the team, the velocity statistics constitute an irreplaceable \\ntool for supporting the team’s estimation efforts. A team that reached its stable velocity or is near it (the \\namplitudes of the sprint velocities are minimal) may use their average velocity as a reference for their target \\nin the upcoming sprints - as a facilitation mechanism.\\nA good practice  for teams, that are more mature and have a stable velocity for a longer period of time, is to \\nchallenge it once in a while. Often teams stick to their velocity as it works, while their potential grows as they \\nlearn to work more effectively together. When things start being easily deliverable within sprints, it’s worth \\nraising the bar just by a bit and see how that works out. If it does - great! Try a bar the next time. If not - don’t \\nworry, go back to the previous assumption and try again in another while.\\n5.7.2 Capacity\\nThe second valuable metric for a Scrum Team is its capacity . Capacity is simply the amount of work that can \\nbe handled by the team in the sprint.

All in all, all 4 metrics provide valuable information, some of which may be more relevant to specific \\nroles than the other.\\nIt’s good practice  for the team to regularly declare their capacity for at least the 2-3 upcoming sprints ahead \\nof time (or more if only possible). This gives the Product Owner a better impact view on the upcoming \\nroadmap.

While team availability is one of the capacity factors, the purpose is \\nslightly different. Having a simple calendar for the team (either in Confluence, or on a big board in the team’s \\nphysical space for co-located teams) which visualizes the sprint including key events, absences, and major \\nmilestones, is an extremely helpful source of information. Images are much more assimilable that words and \\ntext, thus having a graphical, illustrated team calendar is an indispensable tool for maintaining internal team \\nawareness.

Even set aside efficiency/productivity factors, it is physically impossible to dedicate 8 hours \\nof materialized work in a day, due to basic biological needs. In addition, studies show that an average \\nemployee remains productive (with a varying level of effectivity) between 3 and 6 hours per each workday.\\nIt is important to remain realistic when taking into account the baseline data for calculating our capacities \\nand velocities because every deviation from the actual state makes the result less and less reliable. As \\nshown in the example earlier in the chapter, the effective work time was assumed to be 7 hours; frequently \\nfor Scrum Teams, a number between 6 and 7 hours  is taken into account when we consider a standard \\nworkday for an employee when he/she could  be productive. This ensures that we do not base our planning \\non the time we actually don’t have.\\n5.7.3.1 Slack time\\nWhile effective work time needs to be established and defined for proper evaluation of metrics, slack time is \\nnever distinguished from all of the other work of a Scrum Team, even though it may not always be purely \\nrelated to the current scope of Sprint Backlog.\\nSlack time is all the time, which is intentionally or unintentionally used for various types of self-management, \\ngrowth, and improvements within the Developers'\\xa0work. This can be:\\nknowledge transfer, cross-competencies training\\nresearch and experimentation\\nreduction of technical debt\\nimprovement of processes and tools within the team\\nother…\\nEven though slack time  does not directly contribute to reaching the Sprint Goal at the given moment, it is \\ngreatly significant to evolving the team into a high-performing, cross-functional and self-aware organism. \\nUsually, when a Developers complete all of their planned work in the Sprint, before the expiration of the \\ntimebox, it discusses with Product Owner the possibilities of pulling in an additional work item which could \\nperhaps be completed within the remaining time. Quite often the amount of time, which is remaining is \\ninsufficient to complete anything relevant from the top of the backlog (for example a few remaining hours of \\nthe Sprint). That is when the team can become creative and use the time to grow themselves, learn better \\nways of working, learn new tools or work on minor fixes/tweaks of the product to reduce tech debt. In cases \\nof setups, where multiple teams work on a single product, this is also an opportunity to check up on other \\nteams and see if they are in need of a helping hand - quite frequently this will contribute to delivering the \\nhighest value at the end of the sprint, as all of the teams commit to deliver an integrated , potentially \\nreleasable Product Increment.\\nSlack time is not something that should be frowned upon, but encouraged - it fosters self-\\nmanagement\\xa0within the Developers\\xa0and contributes to the growth of a high-performing team, which \\nultimately will pay off.\\n5.7.4 Boards\\nFilter-based boards for Developers\\xa0are standard, supporting tools for tracking and managing team-related \\ntasks in a long-period perspective.

Some of them are addressable by the Developers\\xa0and some need external \\nassistance to help the team resolve the issue. Some are recurring, while others happen no a singular basis. \\nOf course, it is not necessary nor mandatory to track all of the impediments (raising an issue that can be \\nresolved by the team within minutes is overkill), this habit helps in dealing with long-term, recurring or \\nexternal impediments.

The exact path of any hurricane is uncertain, but what meteorologist can do is create \\nsophisticated Monte Carlo simulation models to simulate where the hurricane could go and how likely each \\nof those different paths are.\\xa0\\nFor software product development processes, its possible to simulate range of delivery dates, and the \\nprobability that comes with each date. For any date in the future, it may use some indicator (for example: the \\nthroughput or velocity), to simulate how many work items are likely to get done.\\n5.7.9.2 Flipping coin example\\xa0\\nFor better understanding a concept, lets create very simple Monte Carlo simulation model to represent the \\nuncertainty of flipping a coin. Obviously there is a 50% chance of the coin turning up heads and another 50% \\nchance of it turning up tails. We have two, same probable possible outcomes in that case.

To prevent or limit those arguments and to set up the common \\nunderstanding and approach to the Team cooperation the Team working agreement should be drafted, \\ndiscussed and accepted.

This is because \\nunwritten rules have a tendency to get ignored, forgotten or be understood differently by various team \\nmembers. Also, they are not visible to the new team members and cannot be reviewed and improved.\\n5.8.2.2 Definition of Ready and Definition of Done\\nThe Team page is also a default place where the team is keeping the agreed Definition of Ready and \\nDefinition of Done. Usually, both of them are published in a way of the checklists and are different for the \\nparticular issue type. They should be reviewed with each item in order to make them Ready or Done.\\nIt is good to have the date when the current Definition of Ready and Definition of Done has been last time \\nagreed and changed. This can give the Team input when it was the last time reviewed and if we should \\nmaybe do the update. Changing both the above definitions should not be done without whole Scrum Team’s \\ndiscussion and agreement. You have to also remember that there is a default EG Definition of Ready and \\nDone baseline which is common to all EG Scrum Teams and should also not be changed. The team may \\nbuild on top of baseline DoR and DoD for EG, as well as on top of the Business Unit’s baseline DoR and DoR \\n(if one exists), but may not change the globally binding, existing set of statements.\\nFor more information please read 5.5 - The Definition of Ready \\xa0(see page 176)  and 5.6 - The Definition of \\nDone \\xa0(see page 180)\\n5.8.3 Visualization of team metrics\\nThere are at least two categories of metrics that should be constantly updated and validated by the Team. \\nThose are the Developers capacity and velocity.\\n5.8.3.1 Capacity\\nAt the beginning of each sprint, the Developers are presented with a set of user stories, tasks, and bugs that \\nare the candidates for the upcoming sprint. The team is estimating those items to determine how much work \\nis needed to make them Done. Capacity planning helps a team understand how many story points or other \\nmetrics (i.e. hours) they are likely to accomplish. The Developers' capacity is information about how much \\nwork particular team members are capable to take in the upcoming sprint. When estimating the capacity we \\nhave to take under consideration the availability of the particular team members (all personal day-offs, sick-\\noffs, company day-offs or bank holidays) and the time they can work within the Sprint (i.e. Tester is sharing \\n50% of his time between two Scrum Teams; or planned meetings, training, etc.). For more information please \\nreview: 5.7 - Using team metrics \\xa0(see page 184)\\nIt is necessary to have all this information stored together and updated before the Sprint Planning meeting \\nfor the Developers\\xa0so at the planning the team is aware of the capacity and can plan the Sprint accordingly. It \\nis usually done by creating a table with particular team members and their availability. It can be also useful to \\ntrace if the particular capabilities are well covered. For example, if the tester is available only three days in \\nthe two-week sprint and successful testing is an essential part of the Definition of Done, the Team should \\nplan Sprint a bit different compared to 100% default availability.\\n5.8.3.2 Velocity\\nVelocity is a simple and powerful metric of how much work has been accomplished during the completed \\nsprint and Done stories within it. It is information about how many story points (or another measurement \\nunits) team has completed.

For more information please review: 5.7 - Using team metrics \\xa0(see \\npage 184)\\nIt is very important to store velocity charts or graphs on the Team page and update them once per sprint at \\nleast prior to the Sprint Planning session. There is a possibility to generate a velocity chart in Jira, which can \\nbe used to visualize the velocity (for more information please see: Velocity report41); however using other \\nsimple tools, like excel is also possible. It is available at the list from the “Reports” side menu. It can be easily \\nmoved to the Team page (as a link or as a screenshot to have it visible at the Team Page).\\n5.8.4 Retrospective notes, sprint reports, other reports\\nThe retrospective notes page is being used for addressing all the topics for an upcoming retrospective \\nmeeting that occurs during the sprint. It is also space where the Team is storing all retrospective discussion \\noutputs, agreements and selected points for improvement in the future. For more information please read \\n4.6 - The Sprint Retrospective \\xa0(see page 126)  It is up to the team to arrange the space and store all the \\nretrospective materials. Please review how to create retrospective notes in Confluence: 7.2.2 - Documenting \\na Sprint Retrospective \\xa0(see page 321)\\nAny sort of other reports that may be useful for tracking the Team progress can be also stored on the Team \\npage. This can be Sprint reports or burndown or burnup reports available in Jira from the sidebar “Reports” or \\nany other reports that the Team would like to refer to in order to make assumptions, improvements or info \\nsharing.\\n5.8.4.1 Team events calendar\\nThe team events calendar is a useful source of information about all teams Scrum ceremonies. It can be \\nvisualized in the form of a table where particular meetings (day of the meeting, duration, and meeting room \\nor remote meeting details) are available to the team members and for the stakeholders if needed.\\n5.8.4.2 Team leave calendar\\nThe team leave calendar is information about the absence of all Team members, planned or not planned. It \\ncan provide the Team input about any leaves and their duration. It can be a precious input for team capacity \\nand to plan the Sprint well. It can also give the input to the Developers\\xa0on how to react on unplanned leaves \\n(i.e. sick absence) and to replan the work within the current Sprint. It is essential to update the calendar as \\nsoon as new information about the leave occurs.\\n5.8.4.3 Knowledge base\\nThe Team can also create the Knowledge base space where all the valuable materials about sharing the \\nknowledge can be stored. For example, if one of the team members has training and would like to share the \\ntraining materials, this is the correct space to do it. This is a place for online materials, videos, links, \\ndocuments and everything else that would be useful for the team to be better in the future.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 213}),\n",

It is good practice for the teams to \\nDemo one after another, showing off their input to the Product Increment. In case of a very large \\nincrement or large number of teams, a Review Fair  can be conducted in order to limit the amount of \\ntime needed for the whole review. That way the Demo is parallelized and interested stakeholders can \\nchoose which part of the Product Increment they would like to inspect in more detail.\\ndiscussing and gathering feedback - the discussion during the Sprint Review involves all participants \\nfrom all teams. When having 2 or 3 teams it should be still possible to conduct the discussion in a \\njoint and orderly manner. In case the number of participants is very large, the discussion can be \\nconducted in the form of an Open Space  introducing the “law of 2 feet”. That way the discussion is \\nsegmented and parallelized, allowing all participants to be involved in the topics most relevant to \\nthem.\\nmaking decisions and planning next steps - similarly to the summary, the final stage of the Sprint \\nReview is held in a joint gathering, with the Product Owners and Product Manager playing the main ', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 222}),\n",

There are a few things that should be \\nconsidered when taking into account the distribution:\\ndomain knowledge specialization  - sometimes (however it is not mandatory) the teams can be \\nspecialized in specific domains of the Product; they can be then identified as “feature teams”. Should \\nthat be an attribute that has an impact on the distribution of the Product Backlog items, then it should \\nbe taken into account.\\nFor example: one team specializes in the logistics module part of the system, while another is more \\noriented on the commerce module part of the system.\\nDespite the specializations, all teams should maintain 40-60% of their competences to be available to \\nhandle the entire Product Backlog.\\ndomain knowledge exchange  - if the expected result and goal, that we are trying to accomplish is \\nspreading the team’s knowledge and experience, and perhaps sharing the knowledge about particular \\ndomains among other teams than the distribution of the items could be considered in a reverse \\npattern than that in the previous point. Assigning unfamiliar items (by a small percentage, such as \\n10%) to Scrum Teams, gradually raises their level of that knowledge in a stable, low-risk environment. \\nDuring that time, the team can learn and acquire support from the other specialized team when \\nnecessary - one of the benefits of scaling multiple teams on a single Product Backlog.\\nbacklog items priority  - when considering the distribution of Product Backlog items among teams, \\nthe priority with regard to the single Product Backlog should be well balanced. Try to avoid situations, \\nwhere multiple highest priority items are assigned to one team. This gives a higher chance of \\ncompleting the most valuable items by the Scrum Teams.\\nbacklog items granularity  - when considering the distribution of Product Backlog items among \\nteams, also do consider the size of the item at hand. Ensuring a balanced team backlog requires a \\nvarying dimension of items which are assigned to each team. If the Product Backlog contains various \\nsizes of items, ensure that the team backlogs have this proportion maintained. Loading a single team \\nwith large items (assuming that they cannot be further broken down) will put a higher risk on the \\nsprints of that team.\\nProper grooming of the Product Backlog and pre-planning sessions with the affected teams, should allow \\nbuilding well-refined Team Backlogs, which in turn will make it easier to conduct seamless backlog \\nrefinements by the Scrum Teams in parallel. The teams will be able to create a plan not only for the \\nupcoming cycle but a rough idea of their work agenda for 2-3 Sprints upfront, making it more transparent in \\nterms of meeting the roadmap milestones.Team specializations should not impede the work of an Agile Team by limiting it to a certain \\ndomain, but rather they should allow the team to be a better expert on that domain than other \\nteams.\\uf16f', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 226}),\n",

Nevertheless, no matter how well you plan out the backlog, sometimes \\ndependencies cannot be avoided - it’s just one of the challenges of building complex IT products.

ROAM is an acronym, which defines 4 categories to mark dependencies:\\nResolved - indicates a risk or dependency which has been resolved, either already by having \\naddressed the issue or having a detailed mean to address it in the near future; this indicates that the \\ngiven dependency does not pose a risk for the development of the Product\\nOwned - indicates a risk or dependency which is not yet resolved, but the risk associated with it and \\nthe outcome of the dependency is managed by a specified person, who is accountable for it\\nAccepted - indicates a risk or dependency that has been accepted, since there is no known way to \\nresolve or address it at the given time; usually, this impacts the work to be done by the teams, to \\nconsider proper communication and prioritization in order to avoid negative side effects\\nMitigated - indicates a risk or dependency that has been avoided by other means of addressing the \\nissue, such as: changes in the Product Backlog or item description\\nBy following this technique, managed dependencies can be categorized to dedicate the most focus to those \\nwhich seem to pose the biggest threat and those which do not allow for an easy and quick resolution.\\n6.4 6.4 - Cross-product collaboration by one or more teams\\n\\xa0When delivering multiple products we can distinguish two scenarios:\\na single team is delivering multiple products (high-product-granularity teams);\\nmultiple teams are delivering multiple products (within one Business Unit or across BU's or divisions)\\nEach of the above setups requires a bit different approach, which you can read below.\", metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 230}),\n",

This means that although PO can prioritize only one product development for the \\nupcoming sprint/loop it won't be efficient to put a whole team to move forward with a single product. \\nIt needs a lot of dialog between the Product Owner and developers to find the most efficient balance \\nthat can address the product goals.\\nPrioritization in the longer perspective is crucial. Keeping the above in mind If we want to put more \\nemphasis on the specific products we need to plan them in the longer perspective. This may give the \\ndevelopers time to improve the knowledge shared in the specific areas so when the time comes, \\nmore team members can focus on these products. The more knowledge share we invest in advance, \\nthe more fast and efficient the delivery will be, reaching the expected goals.\\xa0\\nKeeping the focus is always better than context switching. Context switching always costs extra \\nenergy and time (please review THIS44 resource for more information). This means that the more \\nfocused we are throughout the Sprint or in the given time slot, the better results we achieve.

Each team should choose the epics they think belong to them, with little or no \\ndiscussion with the other teams about it.\\nEpic contribution mapping.

Give it a 5, and estimate other features relative to that.\\nOther than that, the teams can just go ahead and break down into features – just like they would \\nbreak down into stories in a Scrum sprint planning session.\\nRepeat that teams with regular intervals will be asked to share the results of their planning with the \\nother teams by the program board.\\n6.5.2.2.7 7. Team breakout\\nSimply let people follow the instructions from the Team breakout intro. Make sure, that the teams get the \\nright amount of attention from the stakeholders and facilitators. Not too much to disturb them, and also \\nenough to give them the guidance they need.\\n6.5.2.2.8 8. Program board\\nTeams post their initial plans on the program board and start coordinating with other teams.\\nGive teams a 15 to 20-minute warning before the first gathering at the program board. Ask them to write a \\nPost-it for each of their features, but for the program board without the description in order to create a \\ncleaner and better overview.\\nWhen the time is up, get everyone up by the program board, and get one from each team (probably the Scrum \\nmaster or the product owner) to place their features in the sprints where the team thinks it belongs.\\nYou might need to encourage a discussion about dependencies between the teams and features, but \\nchances are that the teams will start discussing this without your help when they have it in front of them.\\nHelp visualize the dependencies by connecting features that are dependent on each other with a red string. \\nEncourage teams to finish discussions about dependencies on the side once the dependencies have been \\nidentified, unless it is a dependency that involves all teams.\\nA tip: have the first gathering by the program board earlier rather than later- no later than a couple of hours \\nafter the first team breakout starts. You will probably get some resistance from the teams, because they do \\nnot feel ready yet. If you wait too long, you will not get the cross-team collaboration you get if you do it early. \\nIt is amazing to see how teams are cross-pollinating a lot more after the first program board gathering.\\n6.5.2.2.9 9.

One common technique is using Story Points and Planning Poker, for example. Nevertheless, due \\nto various reasons (as consulted with the team manager) it may occur that teams estimate items using \\nregular time-based metrics, such as hours, minutes, etc. While Story Points estimation in Jira is quite \\nstraightforward, using hourly based estimations on different issue type levels, may introduce some \\ncomplexity.\\nRecapping the basics, as in 5.2 - Refining and estimating an initial Product Backlog \\xa0(see page 152)  - estimations \\nin EG Scrum are done for Product Backlog items (user stories, tasks, bugs, and sub-tasks) as early as during \\nbacklog refinement sessions but no later than during Sprint Planning. Depending on the estimation type \\nselected in KanBan (frequently issue count is the preferred metric, which does not require estimation but \\nrather a proper refinement and granularity) items are usually estimated as soon as during backlog \\nrefinement and no later than being marked ready for development. Of course, estimates assessed during \\nbacklog refinement should be evaluated and confirmed finally during Sprint Planning (EG Scrum) or before \\nstarting the development of the issues. Estimating epics is another topic, which is related to roadmap \\nplanning and high-level estimation, which is not in the scope of this manual.\\n7.1.1.1 Defining an estimate when creating a user story\\nIt is possible to define an Original Estimate  already when creating a user story. In order to do so, simply enter \\nthe value expressed in hours (default) , minutes or days  into the field “Original Estimate”. Some possible \\nvalues are:\\n6 - this will translate into 6 hours, as hours is the default metric (the equivalent of 6h)\\n30m - this will translate into 30 minutes\\n2d - this will translate into 2 days\\nCombinations are also possible, for example:\\n2h 30m - this will translate into 2 hours and 30 minutes\\n1d 4h - this will translate into 1 day and 4 hours', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 245}),\n",

This allows defining a single initial status where all items, which are not ready for \\ndevelopment are stored in a separate compartment, while all items with the next and following statuses are \\nvisible in the KanBan board. That way the KanBan board is more readable and not cluttered with future tasks.\\nIt is possible to define which status is to be part of the KanBan backlog (it is usually the initial one \"To Do\" \\nand the following status which will be the entry point for issues deemed as ready for development.\\nAlso, it is possible to:\\n', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 268}),\n",

This streamlines communication, reduces \\ndelays, and facilitates smoother teamwork.\\nProactive Issue Management : Automation helps proactively manage issues by triggering actions \\nbased on predefined conditions. For example, rules can be set up to escalate overdue tasks, flag \\ncritical issues, or notify stakeholders when certain conditions are met. This proactive approach helps \\nteams stay on top of their work and address potential problems before they escalate.\\nOne of the significant advantages of Jira Software Automation is that it doesn't require coding expertise.\\nUsers can create automation rules and workflows without the need for extensive programming knowledge. \\nTo some extent, you need to have knowledge about the JQL language to be able to create the queries that \\nwill be used in the automation. This empowers users from various backgrounds to automate tasks and \\nprocesses within Jira easily, making automation accessible to all users, regardless of their coding abilities.\\nTo be able to create a Jira Automation Rule on your project level, you need to have project administrator \\npermissions  granted.\\n7.1.12.2 Understanding the automation rules and their components\\nThere are three main components (ingredients) of Jira automation rules:\\nTriggers : Triggers are the events or conditions that initiate the automation rule. They define when the \\nautomation should be executed. Jira provides a wide range of triggers that can be used, such as \\nissue created, issue updated, status transitioned, comment added, field value changed, and many \\nmore. You can select one or multiple triggers based on your requirements.\\nConditions : Conditions are used to define criteria that must be met for the automation rule to be \\nexecuted. They allow you to add additional logic and filtering to control when the rule should run. \\nConditions can be based on various factors, including issue attributes (e.g., issue type, priority), field \\nvalues, issue links, dates, and more. By defining conditions, you can ensure that the automation is \\ntriggered only for the desired set of circumstances.\\nActions : Actions are the operations or tasks that are performed when the automation rule is triggered \\nand the conditions are met. They define the desired outcome of the automation. Jira offers a wide \\nrange of actions that can be performed, such as updating issue fields, transitioning issues to different \\nstatuses, sending notifications, creating subtasks, adding comments, linking issues, and more. You \\ncan select one or multiple actions to be executed as part of the automation rule.\\nBy combining triggers, conditions, and actions, you can create powerful automation rules  that automate \\nrepetitive tasks, enforce business processes, improve productivity, and enhance collaboration within your \\nJira instance. It's important to carefully define and configure these components to ensure that your \\nautomation rules operate effectively and deliver the intended results. In the next chapter below, you will find \\nthe reference materials explaining the components of Jira automation rules.\\n7.1.12.3 Getting started with Jira Automation\\nThis chapter is not dedicated to providing you with a comprehensive introduction, overview, and training on \\nhow to create and manage Jira automation.

Start with automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks before moving on to more \\ncomplex processes. Iterate and refine your rules based on feedback and evolving requirements.\\nClearly Define Automation Goals : Clearly define the goals and objectives you want to achieve through \\nautomation. Identify specific pain points, bottlenecks, or inefficiencies that can be addressed through \\nautomation. Having a clear vision helps you design focused and effective automation rules.\\nAnalyze and Map Existing Workflows : Before implementing automation, thoroughly understand your \\nexisting workflows and processes. Identify the key steps, decision points, and triggers that can be \\nautomated. This analysis ensures that your automation aligns with your actual workflow and doesn\\'t \\nintroduce conflicts or redundancies.\\nMaintain Simplicity and Clarity : Keep your automation rules simple and easy to understand. Avoid \\nunnecessary complexity or over-engineering. Ensure that the rules are clear, concise, and well-\\ndocumented so that they can be easily maintained and understood by both current and future team \\nmembers.\\nTest and Validate : Before deploying automation rules in a production environment, thoroughly test \\nand validate them. Use a test environment to ensure that the rules function as expected and don\\'t \\nhave any unintended consequences. Test different scenarios and edge cases to verify the reliability \\nand accuracy of the automation.\\nMonitor and Review : Regularly monitor and review the performance and effectiveness of your \\nautomation rules. Keep an eye on the execution, trigger conditions, and outcomes of automated \\nactions. This helps identify any issues, fine-tune the rules, and ensure they continue to deliver the \\ndesired results. This can be done by reviewing the \"audit log\" inside the automation details.\\nCommunicate and Involve Stakeholders : Clearly communicate the purpose, benefits, and potential \\nimpacts of automation to all relevant stakeholders. Involve the relevant teams, including \\nadministrators, project managers, and end-users, in the design and implementation process. This \\nensures that automation aligns with the needs and expectations of all involved parties.\\nConsider Maintenance and Upgrades : Automation rules may require updates or modifications over \\ntime. Plan for maintenance and upgrades as your workflows or requirements evolve. Regularly review \\nand optimize your automation rules to ensure they continue to meet your changing needs.\\nBalance Automation and Manual Processes : While automation can bring numerous benefits, it\\'s \\nessential to strike a balance between automation and manual processes. Evaluate the tasks and \\nprocesses that genuinely require automation versus those that may be better suited for manual \\nhandling.

When we go to this board \\nwe will be able to see all the issues that have come from ServiceNow and have not been evaluated yet. All \\nissues coming from ServiceNow have a \"ServiceNow\" user as a reporter and are labeled with the \\n\"servicenow_new\" label. If the supporter from ServiceNow updated the team name, it will also be addressed \\nafter migration to Jira.\\nFrom this point of view, Developers can review, and evaluate the newly introduced issues. Developers in \\nteams or individually can validate if the tickets are having all the needed input, initial parameters and if there \\nare assigned to the proper team. If some input or information is missing it can be commented on with the \\nrequest for an update. All the comments added in this stage will be also visible in the ServiceNow, so \\nconsultants can update the requested content before moving forward.\\nWhen the evaluation is done (including the input, priority, and parameters) Product Owner can prioritize and \\ndistribute the issues to be managed, according to the Agile process established in your Business Unit. The \\nselected issues can be later prioritized in the product backlog along with other items or forecasted for one of \\nthe upcoming sprints immediately. Items with the highest priority can be considered by the agile team to be \\nadded to the ongoing sprint. KanBan teams prioritize the evaluated items in the backlog similarly - once \\napproved for development, they should appear on the KanBan board to be handled with respect to the overall \\npriority of product items in development.

This helps in preventing bottlenecks and delays caused by interrelated work items.\\nProgress Tracking : Teams can track the progress of epics, features, and stories in real time. This \\nvisibility allows for better decision-making and adjustment of plans as needed.\\nScenario Planning : Advanced Roadmaps allow you to create different planning scenarios to explore \\nwhat-if scenarios. This is helpful in assessing the impact of changes or new work items on the overall \\nproject/feature timeline.\\nRelease Planning : It assists in creating and managing release plans, ensuring that the right features \\nand stories are prioritized for upcoming releases.\\nCapacity Planning : Teams can allocate resources and estimate the capacity of their teams for \\nupcoming sprints, releases, or increments. This helps in balancing workloads and ensuring teams are \\nnot overcommitted.\\nRisk Management : By visualizing the entire common scope of work and dependencies, you can \\nidentify potential risks early in the planning process and take proactive steps to mitigate them.\\nResource Allocation : You can allocate resources to different initiatives and projects based on priority, \\nensuring that the most critical work gets the necessary resources.\\nThe most common use cases in EG will be cross-team planning, collaboration, and calibration; Dependency \\ntracking and management as well as overview and management of the common endeavors across products.\\nIn this chapter, we will cover the main features and use cases for our EG use.

Initially, a change team is designated in the \\nbusiness unit, which will be the main contact group throughout the preparation until the kick-\\noff. The best you can do is support the BU and NGA team with building the most suited change \\nteam, which will best represent the business unit. The first meeting together with the NGA \\nteam is during an introductory workshop with the change team, where various aspects of the \\nBU\\'s operation (such as teams, products, processes, tools, etc.) are discussed, for the NGA to \\nbetter understand the BU and its needs. If you are part of the change team, or would like to give \\nyour valuable input to the meeting - the best you can do is to express yourself openly and \\ncompletely, exposing how product development is done and what are the challenged that you \\nare facing. After the introductory workshop is the one of the most vital parts of the process, \\nwhere preparatory work is done by the NGA team together with the BU change team, in order to \\nadjust their processes and tools to be compliant with the target NGA setup. During that time, it \\nis important for the change team to be heavily involved in the discussion and collaboration \\nwith the NGA team to make all aspects of the changes fit the BUs needs. All input is vital to \\nbest prepare for the kick-off; please follow the NGA team\\'s instructions which will guide you \\nthroughout this journey. The NGA kick-off is usually a 2-day workshop where all of the (new) \\nScrum Teams in the BU are onboarded onto the program and start their first sprint in the new \\nway of working. Please be open-minded and participate actively during the prepared \\nworkshops to get the most value out of the meetings. Remember that your maturity both on \\nthe process and tooling side will grow as you proceed also after the kick-off itself, and the \\ndedicated agile coach and devops engineer will help you get the most out of it for some period \\n(depending on the team, usually 3-6 months) after the kick-off.

One of them is to \\nenforce thorough verification of user stories before having them completed, while another is to \\navoid situations where user story scope is negotiated at a final stage and pinged-ponged back \\nand forth (feature creeping). Final approval of a backlog item has high significance, confirming \\nthat such item is delivered as expected (all acceptance criteria are met) by the Product Owner \\nand complies with the EG Definition of Done. We understand that occasionally, due to a human \\nerror, this status may be activated by mistake; on such rare occasions, the team may clone the \\nticket to continue working with proper representation of its\\' status while maintaining the \\noriginal issue linked to the clone.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 420}),\n",

There is only 1 status, which is \\nresponsible for marking all of the work that needs to be done for an item to be completed by \\nthe Scrum Team, and that is \"In Progress\". Testing is just one of the components which \\ncomposes the completion of a sprint backlog item, and similarly to such activities as \\ndocumentation, mock-ups, designs, schemas, etc. may be needed in various aspects \\ndepending on the particular backlog item. The workflow does not reflect all of the micro-stages \\nnecessary for the delivery of a backlog item, because this decision is left to the Developers, \\nwhich decides what actions are needed to deliver the expected result while being compliant \\nwith the EG Definition of Done. All identified \"sub-tasks\" should be created by the team for each \\nbacklog item during the Sprint Planning at the latest and planned accordingly. Test-related \\nactivities should be one of these sub-tasks.\\nHow \\nmuch \\nare we \\nallowed \\nto \\nconfigu\\nre in \\nJira to \\nfit the \\nteam\\'s \\nneeds?The Jira projects created for all of the EG Products in the onboarded business units, represent \\na common NGA Jira project template, which is part of the NGA Common Language in order to \\nbring unification on the tooling and processes part across EG. That is the reason, why core \\nconfigurations like the workflow, issue types and custom fields in Jira restricted and cannot by \\nmodified by any Scrum Team. However, at NGA we understand that Scrum Teams can differ in \\ntheir approach and habits which makes some visual and functional aspects of using Jira \\npossible to be configured according to the team\\'s preference. These elements include: order/\\nvisibility of standard fields on various Jira issue types, custom dashboards/reports, backlog or \\nactive sprint boards view in Jira (especially displaying of additional data on the issue tiles and \\nrecords).

The planned Scrum events in-between the \\nSprints constitute a crucial part of the process, each having a defined purpose that supports \\nthe 3 pillars of Scrum: Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation. After a completed Sprint (2-\\nweek timebox) the Scrum team should evaluate the result of the finished Sprint and re-plan for \\nthe next Sprint to come taking into account all items in the Product Backlog, including those \\nnot completed in the previous iteration.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 421}),\n",

While the NGA \\ndefault recommendation is set to 90 minutes per week, in joint Developers\\' sessions, the \\nbacklog refinement is not limited only to those meetings. The process of backlog refinement \\nincludes all activities, whether it\\'s in group sessions, individual or pair work, that concentrate \\non detailing, clarification, estimation and any preparatory work regarding product backlog \\nitems, which are anticipated for upcoming sprints. According to the Scrum Guide, backlog \\nrefinement should take even up to 10% of the team\\'s capacity each sprint, however it is good \\npractice dedicate as much time as needed in order to have enough product backlog items \\n\"Ready\" that will allow conducting a successful Sprint Planning. Once the Scrum Team is \\nstable on achieving that goal on a sprint-to-sprint basis, the next step is to continue refinement \\nin order to have some \"Ready\" backlog items also available for 2 and 3 sprints forward. Once \\nthe team has a candidate backlog of \"Ready\" items sufficient for 3 sprints ahead, the amount \\nof time spend on refinements can be minimized.\\nHow do \\nwe go \\nfrom \\nestimat\\ning in \\nhours \\nto \\nforecas\\nting in \\nStory \\nPoints?While for the time being, the estimation techniques vary across EG business units, the NGA \\nlong term goal is to focus on a rather relative form of estimation, which will support our agile \\ninitiative and a more reliable way of forecasting work. If the decision made with the business \\nunit is to start with relative estimation, using methods such as Story Points then that will be \\nincorporated into the teams\\' NGA kick-offs to introduce the concept and guide the teams \\nthroughout after it. Some BUs or Scrum Teams may needs some time to become adjusted to \\nthe new way of working, hence the introduction of Story Points into the process may be \\ndelayed accordingly. The readiness and need for going from estimating in hours to Story \\nPoints should be consulted and evaluated together with your agile coach. He will provide the \\nnecessary trainings, materials and guide you through the process to become an even more \\nmature Scrum Team, with the introduction of relative work forecasting techniques. Switching \\nthe technique is just a part of the process, as it requires a general change of midset and the \\napproach to how work is forecasted and accounted for; also to how using Story Points, the \\nteam can benefit from maintaining their velocity and how to use that velocity for a variety of \\npurposes. If you\\'d like to learn more about relative estimation and Story Points, look into the EG \\nAgile Playbook and reach pout to your agile coach.\\xa0\\nScrum Roles / Scrum Team', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 422}),\n",

In EG Scrum, the Scrum Master is not a job function, but \\na role, therefore usually one member of the Scrum Team is granted this privilege and \\nresponsibility. Having a team that consists of a Product Owner and various specialists, \\ndevelopers, testers, designers, etc. it must not be the Product Owner, but anyone else from the \\nteam who is appointed the Scrum Master role.

The responsibility for the outcome rests on the entire team, therefore \\nit is not relevant to have dedicated people to deliver each piece of the Product. Developers \\nshould be able to self-organize and agree on the approach to delivering the expected Product \\nwith all its requirements. Therefore, similarly to the software being delivered, the testing and \\ndocumentation need to be done by the entire team as agreed by the entire team: this can mean \\nthat all members of the team create/conduct test or all members write documentation, even \\nthough their primary focus is coding software.

It is often said that a \\ngood Scrum Master is recognized not by what he/she does, but how his/her team operates \\nwhen their Scrum Master is away. Please remember that the Scrum Master is a role in the \\nteam, who\\'s big part is to educate and support the team in proper understanding of Scrum - but \\nthe entire ownership and responsibility for the following the process and for the end result lies \\non the entire team. While this may not be valid for a \"new\" team (in which case, please ask your \\nagile coach for support), a team that has been working for several sprints in the setup, should \\nhave sufficient knowledge about the process and should be able to continue the business as \\nusual. The activities and responsibilities, such as the facilitation of Scrum Events, should fall \\nonto the other team member(s) during the absence of their appointed Scrum Master. It is also \\npossible to have a Scrum Master from another team (but same EG Product) help out, but that \\nneeds to be a conscious decision taking into account the capacity of that person with respect \\nto his/her first Scrum Team.\\nRegarding the Product Owner role, the situation is a bit different. Since the Product Backlog \\nshould not remain without an active Product Owner at any given time, that the Developers \\ngroup is operational. Should a Product Owner be planning a longer vacation, it must be agreed \\nwith the entire Scrum Team who takes over the responsibility and duties of the Product Owner. \\nThis may vary from team to team, and can differ case by case; some possibilities are: \\ndelegating the role to another Product Owner (who works with a different team in scope of the \\nsame product) or to the Product Manager who should have the possibility to temporarily \\nreplace the Product Owner. If that is not possible, it could be possible to appoint one of the \\ncollaborating consultants who know the product or ultimately (if all else fails) one of the \\nexperienced members of the DEV team. Keeping in mind, that even during the absence, the \\nsubstitute Product Owner should have the empowerment to make binding decisions regarding \\nthe product. This decision needs to be made clearly, taking into account all the mentioned \\nneeds and after consultation with the DEV team.\\nScrum Artifacts\\nCan we \\nhave \\nour \\nown \\ncustom \\n\"Definiti\\non of \\nDone\" \\nand \\n\"Definiti\\non of \\nReady\" \\nfor the \\nScrum \\nTeam?The \"Definition of Done\" and \"Definition of Ready\" are a vital part of the EG Scrum processes \\nwhich are being introduced by the NGA program. In order to maintain best practices and a \\ncohere vision of what it means for a backlog item to be \"Ready\" or \"Done\", we have prepared an \\nEG baseline definition of \"Done\" and \"Ready\" to be used across all BUs and Scrum Teams in \\nEG. These definitions can be found in the EG Agile Playbook.\\nWhile the baseline definitions should not be altered by the BU or the Scrum Teams, they can be \\nexpanded upon. This means that the BU or Scrum Team can enrich the DoD or DoR with \\nadditional statements that make them more qualitative and error-proof with respect to their \\nproduct-specific requirements. It is important to remember that a DoD or DoR for multiple \\nteams working on a single product should be the same across those teams, meaning there \\nshould not be various DoD or DoR for a single EG product.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\The EG Agile Playbook-v3-20231129_183927 2.pdf', 'page': 424}),\n",

Looking at the sprint burndown chart (such reports are available in \\nJira for the entire team) helps the Scrum Team understand where they are as compared to \\nwhere they should be during the 2-week cadence. This understanding in turn allows the team \\nto discuss if any adjustments to their plan are needed in order to meet the sprint goal and to \\ncomplete the forecasted work. It is sufficient to have a look at the sprint burndown chart every \\nother day and that can easily be incorporated for example during the Daily Scrum; however, \\nalong with the team\\'s maturing, the need for frequent inspection of their burndown decreases, \\nas they become more proficient.\\nCan we \\nmodify \\nthe \\nSprint \\nBacklo\\ng?The Sprint Backlog is a list of work, which is forecasted to be completed by the Scrum Team in \\nthe defined Sprint cadence. The issues which are in that list reflect the most prioritized and \\nvital needs of the Product Owner to increase the value of the Product, and should be revised \\nwith the entire team, as it is the Developers who decide on the commitment to the above-\\nmentioned forecast. Knowing that it is important to understand that Scrum embraces and \\nacknowledges change, which is a part of all of our daily lives. It of course can happen that the \\nneeds of the Product change urgently and suddenly - impossible to foresee. In such a case the \\nmost important is to have dialog within the Scrum Team - this can happen ad hoc, or during the \\nDaily Scrum if possible. In that dialog, the whole team needs to respond to the Product (Owner) \\nneed and answer the question: \"How can we make this happen?\" without disturbing the Sprint \\nGoal and our standard processes. Usually, such a requirement implies the need to perform \\nsome rotation in the Sprint Backlog priorities; sometimes this will require descoping several \\nitems or part of an item (further breakdown) from the Sprint Backlog, to make room for the \\nnew request. While that is acceptable and respected, we should always plan the Sprint with the \\nbest knowledge available, to complete all of the forecasted work within the fixed timebox; but \\nof course, we need to react to change and replan the Sprint with respect to the new learnings.\\nAnother case is when the initially planned team capacity drops significantly, due to unplanned \\nevents such as sickness or accident. The natural next step is also to start a dialog within the \\nteam: \"Can we accommodate for the loss of capacity? If yes, how much of it? How can we do it \\nand what should be descoped if needed (should the Sprint Backlog order be revised)\" - those \\nare the questions that the team needs to answer. Once that is accomplished, you should have \\na clear vision of the new plan for the sprint, and at the same time the Product Owner will be \\naware which items from the backlog will be affected by this capacity loss - that will allow him/\\nher to adjust his/her potential obligations to the stakeholders.
